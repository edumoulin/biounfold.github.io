Exploring how AI can meaningfully advance biology and drug discovery — from data to design, in ways that make sense to both biologists and machine learning experts. 

![Profile](/assets/images/etienne-profile.jpg){: .about-photo} **About me.** I
am {{ site.author }}, a data science and machine learning leader in drug
discovery. I write practical, cross-disciplinary pieces for biologists, AI
researchers, founders, and investors — focusing on what actually works in
scientific workflows and strategy. If the ideas resonate, feel free to connect
