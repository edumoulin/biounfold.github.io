### BioUnfold #13 — The Three Layers of Biologics
*How Extracellular, Intracellular, and Genomic Mechanisms Shape Therapeutic Design*

Small molecules have been the centre of this series so far. They are where most of my experience lies, and where AI has been most publicly discussed. But biologics have been redefining the therapeutic landscape for two decades, and they pose a different, often more structured, design space. Their constraints are not the same as chemistry’s. Their opportunities are not the same either.

If small molecules are engineered artefacts shaped by human creativity, biologics are biological molecules shaped by evolution and repurposed by design.

This post steps into that world.

#### What We Mean by “Biologics”

Biologics are therapeutics produced by cells as factories, not chemical synthesis. The category spans proteins, nucleic acids, viral vectors, and engineered cells. Yet the design space becomes clearer when grouped by where they act.

Three layers capture the landscape.

##### 1. Extracellular Biologics

**Examples:** antibodies, bispecifics, cytokine therapies, receptor traps, CAR-T recognition domains

These biologics act **outside the cell** or on the **cell surface**, where targets are physically accessible and structure–function rules are relatively predictable.

**Opportunities**

- High specificity driven by well-understood protein–protein geometry  
- Large-scale screening (phage, yeast, mammalian display)  
- Modular engineering of binding regions  
- Antibody formats (monoclonals, bispecifics, fragments) allow rapid iteration  

**Constraints**

- Limited to surface or circulating targets  
- Poor access to intracellular biology  
- Tissue penetration shaped by antibody pharmacology  
- CAR-T introduces complex in vivo behaviour (expansion, persistence)

Extracellular biologics excel when the disease presents an accessible handle. When it does not, the modality cannot reach it.

##### 2. Intracellular Mechanism Biologics

**Examples:** siRNA, antisense oligonucleotides, enzyme-replacement therapies, intracellular protein modulators

These therapeutics act inside the cell, altering transcription, translation, or biochemical pathways. Unlike extracellular biologics, they rely on mechanistic clarity, not discovery screening.

**Opportunities**

- Can modulate almost any intracellular process  
- Sequence defines function, enabling rapid design cycles  
- mRNA vaccines demonstrated global-scale manufacturability  
- siRNA and antisense oligonucleotides (ASO) therapies offer precise gene silencing  

**Constraints**

- Delivery dominates feasibility (LNP tropism, endosomal escape)  
- Misunderstood mechanisms scale into systemic toxicity  
- Effects are transient unless re-dosed  
- Enzyme therapies must navigate stability and trafficking challenges  

Here, the central question is what mechanism the cell should execute. Once that is defined, the remaining challenge is delivering the payload to the right place.

##### 3. Genome-Level Biologics

**Examples:** AAV and lentiviral gene therapies (viral vectors for delivering DNA), CRISPR editing, base and prime editors, engineered stem cells

These interventions modify DNA itself or deliver genes for long-term expression. They operate at the deepest layer of biological control.

**Opportunities**

- Potentially curative, one-time interventions  
- Ability to replace, silence, repair, or reprogram genes  
- Ex vivo approaches (e.g., CRISPR-edited hematopoietic stem cells) enable precise engineering  

**Constraints**

- Delivery is tissue-specific and immunogenic  
- Effects are long-lived or permanent  
- Redosing is limited by vector immunity  
- Off-target editing and manufacturing add complexity  

Genome-level biologics do not adjust cellular state—they redefine the functional capacity of a tissue.

#### What Comes Next: The Expanding Edge of Living Drugs

New modalities are emerging at the boundaries of these layers.

**Antibody–drug conjugates (ADCs)**  
Bring extracellular precision together with intracellular effect.

**Lysosomal-targeting degraders (LYTACs and related systems)**  
Extend extracellular biologics into controlled degradation of surface proteins.

**Programmable RNA medicines**  
From COVID-19 mRNA vaccines to emerging therapeutics, RNA is becoming a programmable medium: a short-lived instruction set that tells cells what protein to produce. As delivery systems improve, RNA is moving toward modular, distributed control of cellular behaviour.

Biologics are shifting from static molecules to orchestrated systems — designed to bind, enter, edit, or signal.

#### Two Different Games: Chemistry vs Biologics

It is tempting to treat drug discovery as one optimisation problem. It is not.

**Small molecules** operate in a space of exploration: vast chemical possibilities, incomplete mechanisms, emergent ADME, and nonlinear structure–activity relationships.

**Biologics** operate in structured spaces shaped by evolution. Targets must be accessible, mechanisms must be understood, and delivery and manufacturing often dominate feasibility.

Most importantly, extracellular and genome-level biologics can do things chemistry cannot do at all — surface modulation, gene expression, gene repair, engineered cellular behaviour.

The mathematics may converge, but the design problems diverge:

- different priors  
- different constraints  
- different observables  
- different uncertainties  
- different consequences of error  

Thinking clearly requires understanding which game you are in — and which rules apply.
