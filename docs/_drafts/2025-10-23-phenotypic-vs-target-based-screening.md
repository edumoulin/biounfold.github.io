### BioUnfold #2 — Phenotypic vs Target-Based Screening

Drug-discovery programs usually begin with a defining choice:
 **start from a mechanism or from a phenotype**.
 That decision determines how uncertainty enters a project — whether biology is constrained early or explored empirically.

---

#### Target-based discovery

A **target-based** strategy starts with a known mechanism.
 If two proteins should interact and one is misfolded in patients, chemists can design a molecule to restore binding.

 This path is structured: identify, model, optimize, test.
 Much of the early work can occur *in silico*, and progress is easy to track through measurable milestones.

 That clarity explains why most funded programs follow it.
 The kinase inhibitors of the 1990s — starting with imatinib — illustrate its efficiency: clear mechanism, tractable chemistry, reproducible assays.

#### Phenotypic discovery

A **phenotypic** approach starts from an observed effect: abnormal transcription, morphology, or behavior in a biological system.
 Scientists reproduce the phenotype experimentally and test interventions that restore normal function.

 The path is less defined but more inclusive of biological complexity.
 Many first-in-class drugs — statins, aripiprazole, and others — were identified this way, with mechanisms clarified only later.

 Because biological systems are redundant and interconnected, phenotypic screening can expose alternative points of control that targeted campaigns might miss.

#### Comparing the two

Target-based programs optimize for **definition**; phenotypic programs optimize for **generality**.
Both carry risk:

- Mechanistic clarity can hide false positives or irrelevant targets.
- Missing Mode-of-Action information slows optimization and complicates regulatory review.

#### AI now touches both modes.

Models predict new targets from omics and structural data, 
while image and signal-processing systems help classify, rank, and automate phenotypic responses.

The challenge remains constant: learning when statistical correlation implies biological causation.

Funding and publication incentives still favor target clarity over exploratory breadth, steering discovery toward what fits existing frameworks rather than what might expand them.

#### Integrating both views

Effective programs become **both target- and phenotype-defined**.
 Targets must be validated experimentally, and phenotypes must be mechanistically explained before clinical testing.

The issue is not *whether* to connect them but *when*.
Following a single line of investigation is comfortable but information-poor.
Collecting orthogonal data — across assays, readouts, and modalities — is the information-dense path that reveals mechanisms worth pursuing.
