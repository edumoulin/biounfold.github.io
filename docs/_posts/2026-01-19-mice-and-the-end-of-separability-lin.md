Mice are where discovery stops being about isolated biology and starts becoming about treatment.

Upstream systems are built on separability: isolating variables, mechanisms, and signals. In vivo work is where that assumption breaks. Effects no longer compose cleanly. Variability becomes structure. Experiments stop being snapshots and start becoming trajectories.

This post explores why mice studies are not just a scale-up of discovery, but a phase change: where biological knowledge is translated into medical insight, and where programs are first forced to become legible as treatments.
