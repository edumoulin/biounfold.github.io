Abstract — Imaging at Scale: Homogeneity and Ambiguity in Discovery

Imaging remains a foundational modality in biological discovery because it preserves structure: spatial organization, morphology, and context. At scale, however, imaging only becomes operational when this richness is constrained. Experiments are designed to enforce homogeneity, amplify dominant responses, and produce reproducible regimes that can be summarized, compared, and acted upon. This design choice explains the success of high-content imaging in screening and optimization.

Homogeneity is not neutral. By stabilizing experiments, it freezes the space of distinctions the system is allowed to learn. When enforced too early, discovery becomes efficient but brittle, optimizing within a narrow regime while remaining blind to alternative modes of response. Heterogeneity is often proposed as a remedy, but it is frequently misunderstood. Heterogeneity is not a quantity to be maximized, nor a proxy for biological realism. Its primary value is directional: it reveals where dominant explanations begin to break and where new distinctions may exist. Amplitude still matters—strong, penetrant effects remain easier to stabilize and exploit—but direction matters more. Variability becomes scientifically meaningful when it consistently points toward new phenotypic or mechanistic labels that can eventually be enforced through classification and counting.

Historically, heterogeneity was difficult to accommodate within imaging assays because it is expensive under throughput constraints. Discovery therefore scaled along a different axis: multiplying perturbations while holding biology fixed, and introducing heterogeneity discretely across contexts rather than within a single experiment. In the limit, the ideal imaging experiment would observe multiple human tissues perturbed over time, preserving system balance while allowing statistical regularities to emerge before causal certainty. Historically, this ideal could only be approximated locally—through isolated assays, limited contexts, or carefully curated examples—because scaling heterogeneity systematically collapsed tractability. Today, advances in machine learning robustness and assay standardization are shifting this boundary. What was once feasible only in fragments can increasingly be pursued deliberately and at scale, not because ambiguity disappeared, but because our ability to manage it improved.

Seen this way, imaging does not advance discovery by preserving complexity indefinitely. It advances discovery by revealing new separations that can eventually be enforced. The challenge is not to embrace heterogeneity, but to introduce it deliberately—only where it expands the space of classifiable hypotheses, and only until commitment becomes possible.
