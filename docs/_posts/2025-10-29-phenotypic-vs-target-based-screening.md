### BioUnfold #2 — Phenotypic vs Target-Based Screening

![Discovery vs Clarity](/assets/images/biounfold-002-discovery-clarity.png){: width="90%"}

Drug discovery begins with a philosophical choice: **do you define the problem or observe it first?**
Most teams pick one. The best programs combine both.

#### Target-based discovery

A target-based strategy starts with a known mechanism.  
If two proteins should interact and one is misfolded in patients, chemists can design a molecule to restore binding.

This path is structured: identify, model, optimize, test. Much of the early work can occur in silico, and progress is easy to measure. That clarity explains why most funded programs follow it.  
The kinase inhibitors of the 1990s — starting with imatinib — are classic examples: clear mechanism, tractable chemistry, reproducible assays.

#### Phenotypic discovery

A phenotypic strategy begins with observation: a transcriptional, morphological, or behavioral change in a system.  
Scientists reproduce the phenotype experimentally and test interventions that restore normal function.

This path is less defined but more open to unexpected biology. Many first-in-class drugs — including statins and aripiprazole — were identified this way, with mechanisms clarified later. Because biology is redundant, phenotypic screening can expose alternative control points that targeted campaigns might miss.

#### The trade-off

Target-based programs **optimize for clarity**; phenotypic programs **optimize for discovery**.  
Mechanistic clarity accelerates development but can create blind spots.
Phenotypic breadth reveals surprises but makes optimization harder.

AI now touches both modes — predicting targets from omics and structure, or classifying and ranking phenotypic responses from images and signals. But the real challenge stays the same: knowing when correlation implies causation.

#### The real take

These two approaches are not in competition. The smartest teams decide **when to bring them together**, not which one to abandon.  
Relying only on targets makes you efficient but narrow.  
Relying only on phenotypes makes you curious but slow.  
Balancing both makes discovery powerful.
