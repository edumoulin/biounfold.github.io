Data systems are often treated as containers for biology.
In reality, they are representations of biology. And discovery unfolds inside those representations.

Every biotech company operates with a theory of biology. Scientists experience it as intuition, hypotheses, and experimental strategy. But the version that actually governs the organization is the one implemented in schemas, workflows, and tools. That embedded theory determines what the company can notice, retrieve, connect, and ultimately learn.

This post argues three things:

• **Data is not an asset. It is a product.**
Data has no intrinsic value at rest. It becomes valuable only when it is shaped into something people use: to compare experiments, revisit failures, design new assays, and make decisions. Data management is not support. It is production.

• **Data management is a representational problem before it is a technical one.**
What entities exist, what context is captured, what makes two experiments comparable, and how assays relate over time. These choices define the internal biological language of a company. 

• **Ownership is the structural bottleneck.**
Owning data systems means owning the biological concepts of the organization, and being accountable for how they evolve. Without clear product ownership, systems grow by accumulation, concepts drift, and coherence erodes.

This is also why AI collides so hard with data management. Models require explicit context, stable entities, negative results, and meaningful comparability. 

**The real cost of getting this wrong is not inefficiency. It is limitation.**
Data systems define what kinds of capabilities can ever emerge.

Biotech companies build a theory of biology into software, and discovery unfolds inside it.
