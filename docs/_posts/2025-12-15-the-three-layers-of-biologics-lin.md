Biologics have been reshaping therapeutics for twenty years, yet we still talk about them as one category. They are not. Their design space becomes much clearer when grouped by where they act.

1. **Extracellular biologics**
Antibodies, bispecifics, receptor traps, CAR-T recognition domains.
These excel when disease presents an accessible surface. High specificity, modular engineering — but limited reach into intracellular biology.

2. **Intracellular mechanism biologics**
siRNA, antisense, enzyme replacement, intracellular protein modulators.
Here the central question is the mechanism you want the cell to execute. Delivery becomes the main constraint.

3. **Genome-level biologics**
AAV and lentiviral gene therapies, CRISPR editing, base and prime editors, engineered cells.
These do not adjust cellular state; they redefine it. Enormous potential, but long-lived consequences and strict delivery challenges.

Across these layers, a pattern emerges: small molecules work in a vast exploratory space, while biologics operate within structured, evolution-shaped scaffolds. The design problems — and their uncertainties — are fundamentally different.
