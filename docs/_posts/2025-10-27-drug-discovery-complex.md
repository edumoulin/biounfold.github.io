### BioUnfold #1 — Where Biology and AI Unfold

![Biology ∩ AI = Drug Discovery](/assets/images/biounfold-001-venn-li.png){: width="90%"}

**Drug discovery is complex — and complexity distorts meaning.**

Every layer of specialization adds another step of translation.  
Like a long game of telephone, the original signal can fade.

**BioUnfold** is my way to explore the tension between biology, AI, and drug discovery —  
and to uncover where these worlds can truly meet.

The goal is simple: **reveal possibilities hidden in the noise of complexity.**

I will go deep where I know,  
be exploratory where I do not,  
and stay generous everywhere.  

I hope readers will do the same in the comments.

Posts will be frequent, concise, and grounded in real experience.  
They may get technical, but they will stay inclusive —  
written for biologists, AI scientists, and anyone building the next generation of biotech.

By small steps, we can enrich our shared picture of how discovery really happens.  

*Stay tuned.*
