**Discovery is a learning system — and most failures are learning failures.**

Modern discovery is not limited by data or tools. It is limited by how experiments are connected across time.

Most programs move efficiently forward, but collapse uncertainty too early. They stabilize assays, optimize within a narrow experimental world, and mistake repetition for learning. Evidence accumulates — but belief stops moving.

This is why so many programs look strong in models and fragile in reality.

Translation does not fail only in the clinic. It often fails much earlier, when discovery systems stop testing whether their own explanations can travel.

Reframing discovery as a learning system shifts the question from “how fast can we advance?” to “how well do we update what we believe?”

Pipelines scale discovery.
Feedback determines whether it actually learns.
