**Discovery as a Learning System**

In practice, discovery behaves less like a one-shot optimization problem and more like a sequential learning system. Each experiment is not only a measurement, but a decision about what evidence to generate next.

Many programs become very good at improving performance inside a stabilized experimental world. Evidence accumulates, rankings sharpen, confidence increases. What is harder — and often postponed — is testing whether the underlying explanation still holds when the context changes.

This may help explain why programs can look strong across a series of increasingly complex model systems and still struggle to generalize.

Reframing discovery as a learning system shifts attention away from speed or throughput, and toward how uncertainty is preserved, challenged, and updated over time.

Pipelines scale work.
Feedback shapes what the system is actually able to learn.
