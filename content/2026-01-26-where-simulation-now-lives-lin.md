**Simulation has always been part of biology.**  
What is changing is where it sits.

It is no longer only a tool to check explanations after experiments. It is increasingly where biological stories are forced to become executable before experiments happen.

In this essay, I explore how modern simulation and learned surrogates are shifting from *“can this reproduce what we saw?”* to *“what kinds of behavior does this explanation even allow?”* — and why in silico systems are becoming part of the hypothesis engine itself.

*Simulation is not replacing experiments.*  
It is becoming the place where mechanisms are forced to commit to behavior.
