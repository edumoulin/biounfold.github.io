**Short version — Dynamic Experiment Design: Moving Beyond Static Assays**

Most biological experiments are built around destructive measurements. Cells are perturbed, measured once, and discarded. This approach has enabled large-scale molecular profiling, but it limits our ability to study transitions, variability, and causal dynamics. Many biological processes unfold over time, yet most assays capture only a single endpoint.

Live-cell imaging changes this assumption by allowing continuous observation of cellular behavior. Instead of snapshots, experiments can generate trajectories. Early morphological and signaling changes can be detected before transcriptional or molecular differences become visible. This creates an opportunity to design experiments that follow cells over time and intervene selectively rather than sampling populations uniformly.

The key shift is not only technical but strategic. Broad phenotypic observation can be used to narrow the search space, allowing more expensive and mechanistically rich assays to be applied selectively. Monitoring dynamic responses makes it possible to enrich for relevant cellular states, reduce noise, and increase statistical power. This approach concentrates effort on the most informative conditions and accelerates learning cycles in discovery.

Dynamic experiment design emphasizes timing, selection, and iteration. As imaging, sorting, and molecular profiling become increasingly integrated, experimental workflows are evolving from static pipelines toward adaptive and sequential measurement. This shift does not replace molecular assays but changes how and when they are used.

Seen this way, the next phase of drug discovery may be defined less by the scale of measurement and more by the structure of experimentation.
